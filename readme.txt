Tags: map, bing maps, mashup, icon, customized, customised, pushpin
Requires at least: 2.7
Tested up to: 2.9.2
Stable tag: 2.3

== Description ==
This is a simple plugin to create a widget of Bing Maps and, hopefully, insert maps into your posts. A pushpin will be placed at the center of the map. A popup will be displayed when a mouse hovers the pushpin. Now, customised images can be used for the pushpin.
Please have a look the examples at

== Installation ==
*if you previously installed the older ver. plugin, please deactivate it
before installing newer versions. Also, please modify the insertion code on the post accordingly.

Extract all folder and files from the ZIP file, place images, if any, for the pushpin in the 'images' folder and upload the extracted folder to '/wp-content/plugins/'.
Go to the 'Plugins' menu of your admin area and activate the plugin.
Add the widget to your side bar and set it up if you have the latitude and longitude of the location for the map.
To get the latitude and longitude, click the 'View Example' link to open a new window.
The form item 'Latitude' and 'Longitude' in the new window are corresponding to the central location of the current map.
Navigate the map to your target location. 'Latitude' and 'Longitude' should be updated accordingly.
You can also find the sample images for pushpin!
I am terribly sorry to say that there is no direct way to transfer the info to widget settings so please kindly copy them manually!
(when you activate for the first time and/or input invalid latitude and longitude value, 'Random Map' will be displayed.)

= How to insert a map to the post =
On the text area, insert a code in the format of
[bingmap]title,latitude,longitude,width,height,pushpin,zoom,view,dashboard,popup[/bingmap]
where
'title' is the title of your map and the pushpin popup,
'latitude' and 'longitude' are the coordinate values,
'width' and 'height' are map's size in pixel/px
'pushpin' is the name of image file in the 'images' folder.
'zoom' is the zoom level(1-19),
'view' is the map mode(Road/Aerial/Hybrid),
'dashboard' is the navigation dashboard(Normal/Small/Tiny/Hide).
'popup' is the contents of the pushpin popup.

For example,
[bingmap]Seattle,47.606163043868726,-122.33139038085939,200,400,pushpin.gif,10,Hybrid,Tiny,WA USA[/bingmap]
*invalid coordinate values will default the maps to Random Map.

In the HTML editing mode, click a button named 'bing maps' to open a new window.
Navigate the map to your destination, fill up the settings and click 'Get Code'. You can also find the sample images for pushpin!
A code will be supposed to be inserted to the end of the post editing area.
(if not, please manually copy the generated code and paste onto your post.)
The contents of the pushpin popup could be edited in Visual editor to some extent but it's better to keep it simple!


= Web page got blank after upgrading to ver. 2.x =
This is because you didn't deactivate the previous ver. 1.0 before uploading ver. 2.x.
Please remove bing_maps_widget.php from the folder and go to the 'Plugins' menu of your admin
area, make sure ver. 1.0 is deactivated and upload ver. 2.x again.
